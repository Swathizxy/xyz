					<p>This beautiful district in Kerala is very famous for the Palakkad Fort, t
					he Jain temple, the annual Ratholsavam and of course for the extremely beautiful green and lush Malampuzha gardens and dams.</p>
					<p>                                                                                                                         </p>
                       <p>Palakkad is a vast stretch of fertile plains interspersed with hills, rivers, mountain streams and forests and is home to the Silent Valley National Park. 
                       A 40-kilometre mountain pass known as the Palakkad gap at the foothills of the Western Ghats, acts as a 
                       corridor between Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
					   <p>Palakkad was also known as Palakkattussery. Many concluded that Palakkad is derived from 'Pala', an indigenous tree which once densely occupied the land; and hence Palakkad or
					   "the forest of Pala trees".</p>
